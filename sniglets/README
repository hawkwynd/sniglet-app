A sniglet is a word that should be in the dictionary but isn't.
Sniglets are the brainchild of comedian Rich Hall who, with a
little help from his friends,

wrote a series of books containing sniglets in the mid-eighties.
While Rich Hall invented the word "sniglet" itself, sniglets are actually
a long-running popular joke in which people make up their own humorous
words to define things or concepts that have no "official" definitions.
